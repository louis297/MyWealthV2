# Agent rules

## `draft/` is off-limits

Do not read, list, search, edit, create, delete, move, or otherwise touch anything under `draft/`. Treat that directory as if it does not exist. Work from `docs/` and the rest of the repo instead.

## Always commit each step

Create a git commit after every discrete step of work. Do not leave completed steps uncommitted, and do not batch multiple steps into one commit.

- Commit as soon as the step is done and verified, before starting the next step.
- Stage only the files that belong to that step; leave unrelated changes unstaged.
- Use a short, factual commit message that describes what the step did.
- Never commit secrets, credentials, `.env` files, or generated artifacts that should stay untracked.
- If a step produced no file changes, skip the commit.
- Do not amend, rebase, or rewrite history unless the user explicitly asks.
